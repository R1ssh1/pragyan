      "Pipe Bends are manufactured in large radius configurations — 3D, 5D, 8D, and 10D — to provide ultra-low pressure-drop directional changes in piping systems. Their longer radius compared to standard elbows results in lower turbulence, erosion, and noise, making them preferred in high-velocity, abrasive, or pulsating flow services. Produced by induction bending or cold forming from seamless pipe stock in a full range of corrosion-resistant alloys.",
