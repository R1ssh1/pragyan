            <p>
              In 1994, my father, <strong className="text-prayag-black font-semibold">Pandurang Khaire</strong>, began <strong className="text-prayag-black font-semibold">Pragyan Steel & Engineering Company</strong> from a small office in Virar. With nothing but determination, integrity, and the courage to dream, he built relationships with some of India's most prestigious institutions—<strong className="text-prayag-black font-semibold">BARC, ISRO, IGCAR, NFC, NPCIL</strong>. His vision and commitment laid the foundation of a company rooted in trust and strength.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the second generation, I feel a deep sense of pride and gratitude. Pride in the path he created, and gratitude for the trust our clients continue to place in us. Carrying forward his legacy is both an honor and a responsibility—one that inspires me every single day.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a modest trading firm, we have grown into a manufacturing group with facilities in <strong className="text-prayag-black font-semibold">Shirgaon</strong>. This growth reflects more than capacity—it reflects a generational shift, a renewed vision, and our commitment to building for the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              But our journey does not stop here. With strong foundations in pipes, tubes, and fittings, we are also preparing to diversify into <strong className="text-prayag-black font-semibold">equipment manufacturing</strong>—a step that will transform us from a trusted supplier into a complete solutions partner for industries that demand reliability at every level.
            </p>
            <p>
              For us, steel is not just business—it is our identity, our promise, and our strength. Every product we create carries a piece of our family's story, our team's dedication, and our client's trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we look ahead, I invite you to join us on this journey of growth and innovation. Together, we can build partnerships that are as strong and enduring as the steel we shape.
